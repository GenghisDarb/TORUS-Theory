# Deep Research Report: Bicycle Balance Integration Audit (Phase Bicycle v1)

## Summary
This report documents the integration, validation, and repository hygiene steps for the Bicycle Balance Mystery resolution in the TORUS-Theory repository. It includes a mapping of artifacts, validation suite creation, documentation updates, and repository hygiene actions.

## 1. New Files at Repo Root
- The following new files were detected and classified:
  - Notebooks: `recursive_controller_validation.ipynb`, `constant_ladder_residuals.ipynb`, `audio_fft.ipynb`, `shannon_bound_compression.ipynb`, `timing_stats.ipynb`
  - Scripts: `entropy_drift.py`, `chi_modtime.py`, `audio_harmonics.py`, `stack_timing.py`, `extract_doppler.py`, `entropy_drift_pure.py`
  - Data: `recursion14.wav`, `timing.csv`, `entropy_counts.csv`, `chi_modtime_trace.csv`, `entropy_raw.bin`
  - PDFs: `219462.pdf`, `A Low-Power, Long Duration.pdf`, `Measuring pair correlations in Bose and Fermi gases via atom-resolved microscopy.pdf`, `c-823.pdf`
  - Images: PNG files (various, e.g., `entropy_analyze-05-01-2025_01_09_AM.png`)

## 2. Bicycle-Balance Artifacts
- All relevant notebooks have been moved to `notebooks/bicycle/`.
- `recursive_controller_validation.ipynb` is the main Monte-Carlo controller test.
- No eigenvalue CSV or geometry YAML files were found; recommend adding a sample geometry YAML and eigenvalue CSV for completeness.
- No missing data dependencies detected for the moved notebooks.

## 3. Validation Suite
- `notebooks/bicycle/recursive_controller_validation.ipynb`: Monte-Carlo recursive controller lean/steer test.
- `notebooks/bicycle/constant_ladder_residuals.ipynb`: Linearized stability and eigen-plot placeholder.
- Additional supporting notebooks: `audio_fft.ipynb`, `shannon_bound_compression.ipynb`, `timing_stats.ipynb`.

## 4. Documentation
- README sections will be updated to summarize the Bicycle Balance Mystery resolution and link to the validation notebooks.
- No publication draft PDF found for `bicycle_balance_TORUS.pdf` in `docs/papers/`.

## 5. Repository Hygiene
- No stray scratch or checkpoint notebooks found.
- Recommend `.gitignore` entries for `*.ipynb_checkpoints/`, `Untitled*.ipynb`.

## 6. Task List
- New tasks will be added to `task_list.json` for the Bicycle suite.

## 7. Deliverables
- This report (`DR_REPORT_BICYCLE.md`).
- Patch diffs in `DR_PATCHES_BICYCLE/` (notebooks moved, README/CI updates, etc.).
- Updated `task_list.json`.

---

## Patch Diffs

- Moved:
  - `recursive_controller_validation.ipynb` → `notebooks/bicycle/`
  - `constant_ladder_residuals.ipynb` → `notebooks/bicycle/`
  - `audio_fft.ipynb` → `notebooks/bicycle/`
  - `shannon_bound_compression.ipynb` → `notebooks/bicycle/`
  - `timing_stats.ipynb` → `notebooks/bicycle/`

- README and CI updates: (pending)
- Task list updates: (pending)

---

## Next Steps
- Add sample geometry YAML and eigenvalue CSV to `notebooks/bicycle/`.
- Update documentation and CI as described.
- Finalize and commit all changes.
