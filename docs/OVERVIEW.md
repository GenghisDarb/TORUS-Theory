# TORUS Theory Overview

TORUS Theory addresses the challenge of modeling recursive systems in physics and engineering. It introduces a 14-layer recursion framework that predicts emergent phenomena such as χ-field dynamics, β-ladder stability, and OSQN drift. Key predictions include:

1. Stability of β-ladders under structured recursion.
2. Emergent χ-fields in high-dimensional systems.
3. Observable OSQN drift in experimental setups.
