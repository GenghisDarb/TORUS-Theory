\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}
Modern physics has long sought a unifying framework connecting phenomena from subatomic scales to cosmology. The \textbf{TORUS Theory} proposes such a framework by introducing a \emph{universal $\chi$-recursion}: nature is structured as a self-similar hierarchy of 14 discrete layers, each coupling to the next via toroidal flux closures. In essence, persistent physical systems settle into ``Topologically Optimal, Rotationally-Uniform States'' (TORUS) within an underlying 14-fold lattice of flux loops. This hypothesis implies that diverse phenomena share a common geometrical quantization and should exhibit recurring patterns (in parameters and observables) related by factors of $1/14$.
