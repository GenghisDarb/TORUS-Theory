\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}
Modern physics has long sought a unifying framework connecting phenomena from subatomic scales to cosmology. The \textbf{TORUS Theory} proposes such a framework by introducing a \emph{universal $\chi$-recursion}: nature is structured as a self-similar hierarchy of 14 discrete layers, each coupling to the next via toroidal flux closures. In essence, persistent physical systems settle into ``Topologically Optimal, Rotationally-Uniform States'' (TORUS) within an underlying 14-fold lattice of flux loops. This hypothesis implies that diverse phenomena share a common geometrical quantization and should exhibit recurring patterns (in parameters and observables) related by factors of $1/14$.

A key aspect of TORUS is \textbf{observer-state integration}: the theory explicitly includes the measurement apparatus (or observer) as part of the physical state, assigning it a small but nonzero quantum number. This so-called \emph{Observer-State Quantum Number (OSQN)} encapsulates the influence of a ``dormant'' observer on a system. Unlike in standard quantum mechanics, where an unmeasured detector is treated as non-interacting, TORUS predicts even a potential observer slightly perturbs the system (e.g. reducing interference visibility by $\sim 10^{-6}$) as a result of $\chi$-recursion feedback. This built-in observer-state coupling ensures a \emph{structured dimensional closure}: all layers from quantum to cosmological, including the observer, form a closed, self-consistent system. In practical terms, TORUS's 14-layer $\chi$-field provides a global constraint that ``closes the loop'' on physical laws, eliminating arbitrary parameters and preventing divergence of scales.
