# Gravitational-Wave Detection (GWD) Notebooks

This folder contains notebooks for validating TORUS Theory predictions against gravitational-wave data (e.g., LIGO events).

- **LIGO_Echo_Torus_vs_T-HET.ipynb**: Skeleton notebook for comparing the TORUS echo model to the T-HET model using GW150914 data.

Each notebook includes a bootstrap cell, data fetch helper, and placeholder cells for model computation and verdict.
