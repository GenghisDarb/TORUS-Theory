# Bicycle Validation

## Why this folder matters for TORUS
This folder contains notebooks and data related to the "Bicycle Balance Mystery" tests, including Monte Carlo simulations.

## What it contains
- **Notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks analyzing bicycle balance dynamics.
- **Data**: Simulation outputs and processed results.

## How to use
Open the notebooks in Jupyter and execute the cells to analyze the simulation data. Ensure the required data files are present in the `data/bicycle/` folder.

## Next steps
Additional notebooks will be added for extended bicycle validation tests.
