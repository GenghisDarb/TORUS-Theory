## Why this folder matters for TORUS
This folder contains notebooks and data related to entropy drift tests for TORUS validation.

## What it contains
- **Notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks analyzing entropy drift patterns.
- **Data**: Entropy counts and raw data files supporting the analysis.

## How to use
Open the notebooks in Jupyter and execute the cells to analyze the entropy data. Ensure the required data files are present in the `data/entropy/` folder.

## Next steps
Additional notebooks will be added for extended entropy validation tests.
